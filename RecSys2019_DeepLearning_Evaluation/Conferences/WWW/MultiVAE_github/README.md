# Variational autoencoders for collaborative filtering

This notebook accompanies the paper "[Variational autoencoders for collaborative filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05814)" by Dawen Liang, Rahul G. Krishnan, Matthew D. Hoffman, and Tony Jebara, in The Web Conference (aka WWW) 2018.

In this notebook, we show a complete self-contained example of training a variational autoencoder (as well as a denoising autoencoder) with multinomial likelihood (described in the paper) on the public Movielens-20M dataset, including both data preprocessing and model training.
